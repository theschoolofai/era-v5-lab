# Alert tests: fault injection and time to alert (Week 3 rotation)

Each Week 3 rotator in Team 08 tests rules in [`alarms/alarms.py`](../alarms/alarms.py) with an injected fault and
records the time to alert. Add one row per rule you test, plus a short "How to reproduce" note under your name.

## Columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rule_1 & rule_2` | the rule tested, with its severity |
| `injection_mode` | how the fault was injected (synthetic stream, CPU training run, replayed `metrics.jsonl`, ...) |
| `fault_step` | step where the faulty value was written |
| `alert_step` | step where the in-harness `AlarmMonitor.step()` fired; in brackets, the step where a monitor reading `metrics.jsonl` fired |
| `delta_steps` | `alert_step - fault_step` (in-harness; in brackets, the `metrics.jsonl` path) |
| `in_harness_ms` | `time.perf_counter()` around `AlarmMonitor.step()` on the faulty step |
| `jsonl_flush_to_alert_ms` | from `MetricsWriter.write()` on the faulty step until a monitor reading `metrics.jsonl` fires for it |
| `verdict` | PASS if the expected rule and severity fire on the faulty step, with no false alarms |

## Results

## @raghavTayal: `non_finite` and `spike_score` (Issue #19)

**Setup.** [`alarms/test_alert_injection_raghav.py`](../alarms/test_alert_injection_raghav.py) runs a 150-step
synthetic training stream (seed 19): `loss_ntp = 2.2 + 1.5·exp(−step/60)` plus Gaussian noise (σ = 0.01), and `lr`.
Every step is written through `MetricsWriter` (`flush_every = 10`) and checked twice:

- **in-harness:** `AlarmMonitor.step()` on the same values the trainer writes;
- **`metrics.jsonl`:** a second `AlarmMonitor` reads each newly flushed line the way `alarms.py --jsonl` does.

**Faults.**
- `spike_score`: `loss_ntp` + 5.0 at step 125 (125 clean steps first, so the 100-step window is warm).
- `non_finite`: `loss_ntp = NaN` at step 140.

**Results.** Both rules fire with the expected severity on the faulty step in-harness, and there are no other alarms
on either path. The timings are from one run on a laptop CPU (Apple Silicon, Python 3.14); they vary by a few
microseconds between runs.

**Finding: the `metrics.jsonl` path sees a finite fault only at the next flush.** `MetricsWriter` flushes a row with
a non-finite value at once (stored as `"nan"`), so `non_finite` reaches the file on the same step. A finite spike row
stays in the buffer until the next `step % 10 == 0` flush, so a monitor that reads the file sees the step-125 spike
at step 130: up to `flush_every − 1` = 9 steps late. The milliseconds above are small only because a synthetic step
takes microseconds. In a real run, the file-path delay for `spike_score` is about `delta_steps × step time`. The
in-harness monitor in `train.py` has no such delay.

**How to reproduce.**

```bash
python -m pytest teams/08-monitoring/alarms/test_alert_injection_raghav.py -q   # 5 tests
python teams/08-monitoring/alarms/test_alert_injection_raghav.py                 # prints the two table rows
```

The test needs only `pytest` (no NumPy or torch). It checks the rule, severity, `delta_steps = 0` in-harness, the
`metrics.jsonl` flush lag (0 for NaN, 5 for the step-125 spike), no false alarms, non-negative timings, and that the
NaN row is stored as `"nan"`.

## @s9k96: `moe_routing` and `ema_z` (Issue #19)

**Setup.** [`alarms/test_alert_injection_s9k96.py`](../alarms/test_alert_injection_s9k96.py) runs a 200-step
synthetic stream (seed 19): `gradient_norm = 1.0 + N(0, 0.05)`, an 8-expert `expert_load` (shares near 1/8, noise 5%),
`loss_ntp` and `lr`. Every step goes through `MetricsWriter` (`flush_every = 10`) and is checked in-harness and
from `metrics.jsonl`, as in the Raghav test. Both monitors use `AlarmMonitor(ema_z_threshold=5.0, moe_patience=5)`:
`ema_z` is off by default, and `moe_routing` waits 1,000 steps by default, longer than this stream.

**Faults.**
- `ema_z`: `gradient_norm` + 0.35 at step 155 (about 6 sigma: above the EMA z threshold 5.0, below `spike_score`'s
  7 sigma). The alarm reports z = 6.29.
- `moe_routing`: expert 3 gets no tokens at steps 120-129. The rule needs `moe_patience` consecutive bad steps,
  so the expected alert step is 120 + 5 - 1 = 124, and `delta_steps = 4` is by design, not lag.
  For this row `jsonl_flush_to_alert_ms` runs from the write of the step-124 row.

**Results.** Both rules fire with severity `warn` on the expected step in-harness, once each, and nothing else fires
on either path (`spike_score` stays quiet on the 6-sigma jump). The timings are from one run on a laptop CPU
(Apple M5, Python 3.15); they vary by a few microseconds between runs.

**Finding 1: `spike_score` silences `ema_z` on the same step.** With `ema_z` enabled, a +0.35 jump (6 sigma)
fires only `ema_z`. A +1.0 jump (about 20 sigma) fires only `spike_score` (page): `ema_z` is skipped when the step
has already paged, so enabling it adds a `warn` for moderate jumps and nothing for large ones. The test
`test_finding_spike_score_silences_ema_z_on_same_step` records this.

**Finding 2: an expert at 5% of a fair share is dead for `MetricsWriter` but not for `moe_routing`.** The writer
counts an expert below 10% utilization as dead (`dead_experts_count`). `moe_routing` counts `dead_experts` only
at an exact load of 0.0, and otherwise needs MaxVio > 1.0. With one of 8 experts at 5% of a fair share for 10 steps,
the row has `dead_experts_count = 1`, MaxVio is about 0.14, and no alarm fires. A partly collapsed router is on the
dashboard but never pages. The test `test_finding_expert_at_5_percent_is_dead_for_writer_but_not_for_moe_routing`
records the current behavior; if the rule changes to use the writer's threshold, update that test.

**Finding 3: time to alert for `moe_routing` is set by `moe_patience`.** With the default 1,000 steps, the same fault
alerts at step 1,119. On the `metrics.jsonl` path the alert is 10 steps after the fault here (step 130, the next flush).

**How to reproduce.**

```bash
python -m pytest teams/08-monitoring/alarms/test_alert_injection_s9k96.py -q   # 6 tests
python teams/08-monitoring/alarms/test_alert_injection_s9k96.py                 # prints the two table rows
```

The test needs only `pytest` (no NumPy or torch). It checks the rule, severity and alert step in-harness, the
`metrics.jsonl` flush lag (5 for `ema_z`, 10 for `moe_routing`), no false alarms, non-negative timings, and the two
findings above.

## @pyru: `static_bound` and `throughput_drop`

**Setup.** [`alarms/test_alert_injection_pyru.py`](../alarms/test_alert_injection_pyru.py) runs a 400-step
synthetic stream (seed 23): `loss_ntp`, `lr`, `tokens_per_second = 38,000 + N(0, 400)` (650 on step 0, a slow setup
step) and `gpu_alloc_gib = 24.5 + N(0, 0.05)`. Every step goes through `MetricsWriter` (`flush_every = 10`) and is
checked in-harness and from `metrics.jsonl`, as in the Raghav test. Both monitors use
`AlarmMonitor(bounds={"gpu_alloc_gib": (None, 40.0)})`, the bound in `tests/test_alarms.py`; `throughput_drop` uses
the default settings (10% drop, 100 steps).

**Faults.**
- `static_bound`: `gpu_alloc_gib` about 44 GiB on steps 125-144. The rule latches, so it fires once, at step 125.
- `throughput_drop`: `tokens_per_second` 25% below normal on steps 200-349. The rule needs 100 slow steps in a row,
  so the expected alert step is 200 + 100 - 1 = 299, and `delta_steps = 99` is by design, not lag.
  For this row `jsonl_flush_to_alert_ms` runs from the write of the step-299 row.

**Results.** Both rules fire with severity `warn` on the expected step in-harness, once each, and nothing else fires
on either path, including the slow step-0 setup value. The timings are from one run on a laptop CPU (Windows 11,
Python 3.12); `jsonl_flush_to_alert_ms` was 3.6 to 4.8 ms over four runs, mostly the disk sync in
`MetricsWriter.flush()`.

**Finding 1: `static_bound` is off unless the caller passes `bounds`.** `AlarmMonitor()` (the README example) and
`alarms.py --jsonl` set none, and the CLI has no option for them. For dry run 1 the harness must pass `bounds`, or
this rule never fires. The test `test_static_bound_is_off_without_bounds` records this.

**Finding 2: time to alert for `throughput_drop` is set by `tps_patience`.** In a real run it is 100 slow steps,
`tps_patience × normal step time / (1 - drop)`: with a 25% drop, about 133 normal step times, so under one minute
only if a normal step takes less than 0.45 s. A 99-step slowdown never alerts, and neither does a drop under 10%.

**How to reproduce.**

```bash
python -m pytest teams/08-monitoring/alarms/test_alert_injection_pyru.py -q   # 8 tests
python teams/08-monitoring/alarms/test_alert_injection_pyru.py                 # prints the two table rows
```

The test needs only `pytest` (no NumPy or torch). It checks the rule, severity and alert step in-harness, the
`metrics.jsonl` flush lag (5 for `static_bound`, 1 for `throughput_drop`), one alarm per fault and no false alarms,
non-negative timings, the 99-step, 100-step and 8% slowdowns, re-arming of `static_bound`, and finding 1.
