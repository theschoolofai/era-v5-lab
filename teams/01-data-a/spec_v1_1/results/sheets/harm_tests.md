# Spec v1.1 harm tests: the new diseases and their medicines

**The ask** (instructor, due Fri 13 Nov): "Pipeline owner: for each new disease above 1%, write a medicine and a harm test for spec v1.1."

This file records, for each new disease above 1%, its medicine and its harm test.
- **New** means not in `diagnosis/DISEASES.md`.
- **Above 1%** means 1% or more of the docs read in its domain, as counted in `teams/01-data-a/reading/reading_check_v1.md`.

The diseases, codes and rule IDs come from `../../sheets/NEW_DISEASES.md`. The rules themselves are in `../../sheets/medicine_english.md`, `../../sheets/medicine_math.md` and `../../sheets/medicine_sci.md`.

## How the harm tests were run

- **Tool:** the team's `teams/01-data-a/harmtest/harm_test.py`, run unchanged, with `--rule all`. It was `tools/harm_test.py` until theschoolofai/era-v5-lab#244 moved it on 13 Nov; the code is byte-identical, so every run here holds. That runs each rule alone, then all of a sheet's rules in order (ALL IN ORDER). A drop ends a doc, and a fix passes the new text on.
- **Command,** from the repo root, once per pack:

  ```
  python3 -I teams/01-data-a/harmtest/harm_test.py --pack <pack>.parquet --gold teams/01-data-a/gold/<pack>_gold.csv \
    --rules teams/01-data-a/spec_v1_1/sheets/medicine_<domain>.md --rule all --report teams/01-data-a/spec_v1_1/results/sheets/<pack>_harm.json
  ```
- **Data:** the Week 1 pack files, and the Data A gold set of each pack, which is the docs two readers agreed are clean.
- **Limit:** gold docs changed plus dropped must be at most `max(1, floor(1% of gold))`. Each pack is judged on its own, never pooled. A gold doc counts as touched if any character changes or the doc is dropped.

  | packs | gold docs | limit |
  |---|---|---|
  | math-finemath | 86 | 1 |
  | math-megamath | 26 | 1 |
  | sci-finepdfs | 202 | 2 |
  | en-dclm | 62 | 1 |
  | en-fineweb-edu | 158 | 1 |
  | en-nemotroncc | 129 | 1 |
  | en-nemotroncc-synth | 326 | 3 |
- **Reports** (IDs and counts only): one `<pack>_harm.json` per pack in this folder, for the 2 math packs, sci-finepdfs and the 4 English packs.
  - **Code sha256:** `538501e9…` for `medicine_math.md`; `82b62928…` for `medicine_sci.md` (13 Nov, sections 1–12 after the gold-doc fixes; it was `3efa627d…` with sections 1–6); `8fb54cd5…` for `medicine_english.md`.
  - **Older English reports:** `en-dclm`, `en-fineweb-edu` and `en-nemotroncc` are from the run with the withdrawn `DA-D6-002` still in the sheet (code `22853296…`). That rule was off on those three packs, so the results for the two remaining rules are the same.
  - **Commit:** the math rules and reports are from `14d4549` on `g1-spec-v1-1` (patilvijay23/era-v5-lab). The science update of 13 Nov (sections 7–12 and the new `sci-finepdfs_harm.json`) is not committed yet.
- **What else was checked:**
  - each rule's unit tests (`tests/test_medicine_english.py`, `tests/test_medicine_math.py`, `tests/test_medicine_sci.py`), listed per medicine under "Unit tests for each medicine" below;
  - how many of the readers' docs each rule catches on the cleaned sample (`scripts/reading_recall.py`).

## Each new disease: medicine and harm test

The harm column gives the gold docs changed plus dropped, over the gold docs, for each pack the rule was tested on.
- A rule is tested on every gold set of its family. On a pack outside its `ORIGIN`, it keeps every doc by design; this is marked "not in ORIGIN".
- "Reading docs treated" counts the readers' docs with the disease that the rule changes or drops.

### Math: 299 docs read, so a disease needs 3

| # | new disease (reading code) | docs, rate | rule | action | medicine | harm test (alone) | reading docs treated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Content lost in extraction: formulas (NEW-missing-formulas) | 29, 9.7% | `DA-C7-001` | drop | Drops a doc with 4 or more gaps that lost formulas leave: a line ending in `=` or a word like "is" before a new sentence, `show that .`, empty answer options, a `?` where a value should be. | finemath 0/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 PASS | 4 / 29 |
| 2 | Layout lost in extraction: flattened formulas (NEW-flattened-formulas) | 22, 7.4% | `DA-C8-001` | drop | Drops a doc where a formula is split one token per line: 8 or more short lines in a row, 2 or more of them with an operator. Option labels such as `(a)` break the run. | finemath 0/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 PASS | 3 / 22 |
| 3 | SEO filler (NEW-seo-filler) | 15, 5.0% | `DA-C9-001` | fix + drop | Drops SEO landing pages by the sentences only they write: tutoring and homework-app sales lines, the 6ya line, exam-tips filler, a "Road distance" page, the ebook spinner. Removes the "You are watching: …" line that copying sites add. | finemath 0/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 PASS | 8 / 15 |
| 4 | Words run together (NEW-missing-spaces) | 13, 4.3% | `DA-A8-001` | fix | Puts the space back where a lowercase word runs into a capitalised word that starts a sentence or heading (`HydrogenWhen` → `Hydrogen When`, `here.The` → `here. The`). It leaves code lines, code fences and brand names alone. | finemath 1/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 PASS | 5 / 13 |
| 5 | Layout lost in extraction: merged table cells (NEW-merged-table-cells) | 11, 3.7% | `DA-C8-002` | drop | Drops a doc with a flattened table row: a line of 20 or more tokens, at least 80% of them numbers or operators. | finemath 0/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 PASS | 3 / 11 |
| 6 | Pages made for search: template pages (NEW-template-pages) | 9, 3.0% | `DA-C9-003` | drop | Drops calculator, unit-converter and number-fact pages made from a template, recognised by any of three signs: their fixed headings, a sentence only converter sites write, or one value repeated in the headings. | finemath 1/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 PASS | 8 / 9 |
| 7 | Machine-written text (NEW-ai-generated-text) | 8, 2.7% | `DA-D6-001` | fix + drop | On a forum page, it removes the "In summary, the conversation …" line and the numbered FAQ the forum adds. It drops a machine-written article that shows 2 of these signs: FAQ headings, a Conclusion heading, 3 or more intro-style headings, an "In summary/In conclusion," sentence. | finemath 0/86 PASS · megamath 0/26 (not in ORIGIN) | 3 / 8 |
| 8 | Content lost in extraction: figures (NEW-missing-figures) | 5, 1.7% | `DA-C7-002` | drop | Drops a problem that refers to a missing figure, plot or drawing: twice, or once in a doc under 2,000 characters. | megamath 0/26 PASS · finemath 0/86 (not in ORIGIN) | 4 / 5 |

### Science: 200 docs read, so a disease needs 2

Aditeya read 100 docs (mittalutkarsh/era-v5-lab#3) and Utkarsh read 100 (mittalutkarsh/era-v5-lab#5). Utkarsh's reading was added on 13 Nov, and rows 15–20 come from it.

| # | new disease (reading code) | docs, rate | rule | action | medicine | harm test (alone) | reading docs treated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | Word split in extraction: line-end hyphen (NEW-hyphen-split-words) | 3, 1.5% | `DA-A7-001` | fix | Joins a word split at a line end (`stereo- scopic` → `stereo-scopic`) and keeps the hyphen. Suspended hyphens such as `pre- and post-` stay. | sci-finepdfs 1/202 PASS | 3 / 3 |
| 10 | Layout lost in extraction: merged table cells (NEW-merged-table-cells) | 3, 1.5% | `DA-C8-003` | fix | Splits a table cell that holds two numbers into the empty cell next to it (`\| 332 50.4 \|  \|` → `\| 332 \| 50.4 \|`). | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 1 / 3 |
| 11 | Content lost in extraction: table body or list (NEW-missing-table-data) | 3, 1.5% | `DA-C7-003` | fix | Cuts a dangling "… with the following members." when no list follows it. | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 1 / 3 |
| 12 | Layout lost in extraction: reading order (NEW-reading-order) | 2, 1.0% | `DA-C8-004` | fix | Puts numbered steps that are out of order back in order (3, 5, 4 → 3, 4, 5). | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 1 / 2 |
| 13 | SEO filler (NEW-seo-filler) | 2, 1.0% | `DA-C9-002` | drop | Drops "ebook" pages made by a text spinner, recognised by the sentences only the spinner writes. | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 2 / 2 |
| 14 | Blank form fields (NEW-underscore-blanks, NEW-form-blanks) | 7, 3.5% | `DA-B6-001` | drop | Drops a blank form: one where underscore runs make up 30% or more of the text. | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 2 / 7 |
| 15 | Layout lost in extraction: page numbers and footers (NEW-page-artifact) | 9, 4.5% | `DA-C8-005` | fix | Deletes `Page N` / `Page N of M` lines, an unfilled `Page No. – Page No.`, a date-only line that stands alone and repeats, and a lone page number as the first line, the last line after a finished sentence, or between two lines of running text. | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 8 / 9 |
| 16 | Words run together (NEW-missing-spaces) | 3, 1.5% | `DA-A8-002` | fix | Puts a space back in front of a listed field label glued to the word before it (`MACEDuration:` → `MACE Duration:`). | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 1 / 3 |
| 17 | Word split in extraction: drop cap (NEW-drop-cap-split) | 2, 1.0% | `DA-A7-002` | fix | Joins a lone capital letter to the lowercase line after it (`D` / `eveloping` → `Developing`). `A` and `I` are left. | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 1 / 2 |
| 18 | Word split in extraction: small caps (NEW-small-caps-split) | 2, 1.0% | `DA-A7-003` | fix | Joins a split first letter back (`F OODS` → `FOODS`) on lines set in small caps (no lowercase letter, more split pairs than whole capital words), in a doc with 3 or more splits. | sci-finepdfs 0/202 PASS | 2 / 2 |
| 19 | Content lost in extraction: figures (NEW-missing-figures) | 2, 1.0% | `DA-C7-004` | fix | Replaces each Markdown image link to a bare `image` / `image1.png` with its caption as text, and deletes links with no caption. | sci-finepdfs 3/202 **FAIL**, all 3 gold contradictions | 2 / 2 |

### English: 200 docs read, so a disease needs 2

Four readers read 50 docs each:
- narasimhatejav, en-fineweb-edu (mittalutkarsh/era-v5-lab#7)
- kunal, en-nemotroncc-synth (mittalutkarsh/era-v5-lab#8)
- aneesha, en-nemotroncc (mittalutkarsh/era-v5-lab#9)
- Smita, en-dclm (patilvijay23/era-v5-lab#36)

Each English rule also keeps every doc of en-dclm and en-fineweb-edu, which aren't in its `ORIGIN` (both 0, PASS).

| # | new disease (reading code) | docs, rate | rule | action | medicine | harm test (alone) | reading docs treated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | Words run together (NEW-missing-spaces) | 2, 1.0% | `DA-A8-003` | fix | Puts the space back after a full stop between a lowercase word and a capitalised one (`choose.Compose` → `choose. Compose`). It leaves URLs, abbreviations and code alone. | en-nemotroncc 1/129 PASS (a gold contradiction) · en-nemotroncc-synth 0/326 (not in ORIGIN) | 1 / 2 |
| 22 | Facts the rewrite got wrong (NEW-factual-error), new code D7 | 4, 2.0% | `DA-D7-001` | drop | Quarantines the 6 confirmed docs by doc_id: kunal's 4, and 2 wrong answers from appended Q&A. Nothing in the text marks a wrong fact, so it finds no other cases. | en-nemotroncc-synth 0/326 PASS (trivial: no listed doc is gold) · en-nemotroncc 0/129 (not in ORIGIN) | 4 / 4, and the 2 wrong answers |
| 23 | Machine-written text: an appended question and answer (NEW-appended-qa) | 3, 1.5% | `DA-D6-002`, **withdrawn** | — | It removed trailing `Question: … Answer: …` lines, and caught all 3 reading docs. | en-nemotroncc-synth **32/326 FAIL** in its first run | 3 / 3 |

**Why `DA-D6-002` was withdrawn** (aneeshads, 13 Nov):
- **The 32 gold docs:** each ends in ordinary, correct Q&A (1 to 4 pairs). Appended Q&A is part of this synthetic pack, and the gold readers marked it clean.
- **No narrower rule:** nothing in the text separates kunal's docs. A score for how much of the answer appears in the passage gives 0.67, 1.00 and 1.00 for his 3, and 0.50 to 1.00 for the gold docs.
- **kunal's 3 docs:** his 2 wrong answers are facts the rewrite got wrong, so they went to `DA-D7-001`; the third answer is correct.
- **Open:** whether appended Q&A is a disease is for the team to rule.

**Of the 22 medicines in force, 21 pass their harm test on their own.** `DA-C7-004` fails: it changes 3 of 202 gold docs, against a limit of 2, and all 3 have the disease itself (gold contradictions, below). With them left out, it passes at 0/199. A 23rd, `DA-D6-002`, was withdrawn after failing at 32/326. Data B's `DB-C6-001`, the 23rd medicine in `specv1_1.md`, also fails alone: 2/80 on ind-te-sangraha-v, both gold contradictions, so 0/78 without them (see "Other families and diseases").

## All the rules of a sheet together (ALL IN ORDER)

| pack | gold docs (limit) | changed | dropped | result | gold docs touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| math-finemath | 86 (1) | 1 | 1 | **FAIL** (2/86) | `2d328b828fa97706` (`DA-A8-001`), `0f119a596e8b7f63` (`DA-C9-003`) |
| math-megamath | 26 (1) | 0 | 0 | **PASS** | none |
| sci-finepdfs | 202 (2) | 4 | 1 | **FAIL** (5/202) | `920855df51f37db8` (`DA-A7-001`); `4b958ac1f45443b5`, `d0a0a41263e845f5`, `eb6ad9726f2d7ddd` (`DA-C7-004`); `b6fd81dbf90b0d17` dropped (`DA-C7-005`) |
| en-dclm | 62 (1) | 0 | 0 | **PASS** | none |
| en-fineweb-edu | 158 (1) | 0 | 0 | **PASS** | none |
| en-nemotroncc | 129 (1) | 1 | 0 | **PASS** (1/129) | `056cc9bc44c927e2` (`DA-A8-003`) |
| en-nemotroncc-synth | 326 (3) | 0 | 0 | **PASS** | none (32/326 FAIL before `DA-D6-002` was withdrawn) |

With sections 1–6 only (12 Nov), sci-finepdfs was 1/202 PASS in order. With all 12 rules, the first run of 13 Nov was 9/202. After the gold docs were read and two rules narrowed, it is 5/202. 4 of those 5 are gold contradictions. With them left out, it passes at 1/198.

### Science gold docs read on 13 Nov

The first run of the 12 rules touched 8 gold docs, and all 8 were read:
- **`DA-A7-003`, real harm in 3 docs:** `322dc47ddcb0a780` (course codes `G HIST` → `GHIST`), `b31b17ba09b9a8b8` (`A COMPREHENSIVE` → `ACOMPREHENSIVE`, `D AND E` → `DAND E`) and `d8df5df66bb7a574` (`CECILY’S ENGLISH` → `CECILY’SENGLISH`). The rule was narrowed to lines set in small caps, and now touches 0.
- **`DA-C8-005`, real harm in 1 doc:** `8a2493cdf33f9a38` lost the date under each signed comment. A date footer now has to stand alone between blank lines, and the rule touches 0.
- **`DA-C7-004`, gold contradictions in 3 docs:** `4b958ac1f45443b5`, `d0a0a41263e845f5` and `eb6ad9726f2d7ddd` each have empty image links. The first version also deleted their captions, so it now keeps them as text.
- **`DA-C7-005`, a false positive within the limit:** `b6fd81dbf90b0d17` is a complete 220-character certificate.

### Gold contradictions

Each gold doc touched has the very disease its rule targets. The gold set was built in Week 1, before these diseases were named.

| gold doc | rule | what is in it |
|---|---|---|
| `2d328b828fa97706` | `DA-A8-001`, words run together (fix) | `fieldtrip.Write an equation`: a missing space after a full stop. The rule makes it `fieldtrip. Write`. |
| `0f119a596e8b7f63` | `DA-C9-003`, template pages (drop) | A grams-to-kilograms converter page, with the same template headings as reading doc `d0693c18056bae02` ("Alternative conversion", "Approximate result", "Conversion table", "… chart"). |
| `920855df51f37db8` | `DA-A7-001`, hyphen-split words (fix) | A word split at a line-end hyphen in a Finnish abstract. This one is within the limit. |
| `4b958ac1f45443b5` | `DA-C7-004`, empty image links (fix) | `![Fig. 4. XPS of C dots …](image)` and `![Fig. 5. EDAX …](image)`: figure legends in links to an image that isn't there. |
| `d0a0a41263e845f5` | `DA-C7-004`, empty image links (fix) | `![Biotin](image)`, `![Folate](image)`, `![Ascorbic acid](image1.png)` and 4 more: structure drawings that aren't there. |
| `eb6ad9726f2d7ddd` | `DA-C7-004`, empty image links (fix) | `![Diagram](image)` after "according to the following diagram:". |
| `056cc9bc44c927e2` | `DA-A8-003`, words run together (fix) | `tantrum.To the sociopath`: a missing space after a full stop, in en-nemotroncc. This one is within the limit. |
| `85644a4840025b6f` | `DB-C6-001`, runs of dots (fix), ind-te-sangraha-v | A bare `..` after మాట్లాడుతూ ("speaking"), before a quote. oddjoker91 labelled a bare `..` as C6 in other docs of the pack. |
| `01418489e7410bdf` | `DB-C6-001`, runs of dots (fix), ind-te-sangraha-v | A bare `..` after మరణిస్తే ("if they die"), at the end of a clause. |

**Handling** (proposed by aneeshads on 13 Nov; **Vijay agreed**): they are marked as gold contradictions, as spec v1 did for `eee25e81417bc1b7` in sci.
- They are left out of the count for these rules only.
- They are flagged for a reader to check again at the next gold refresh.

With the two finemath docs left out, finemath in order touches 0 of the other 84 gold docs and passes. With the two Indic docs left out, `DB-C6-001` passes at 0/78. The gold CSVs, `harm_test.py` and `harm_test_indic.py` are not changed.

## Unit tests for each medicine

The harm test checks a rule against the gold set. The unit tests check that it does what its card says: what it must change or drop, what it must leave alone, and that running it twice gives the same text.
- **How they load the rules:** each test file loads its sheet the way `harmtest/harm_test.py` does (`harm_test.load_rules`), so the tests run the same code as the harm test.
- **Text:** all of it is made up. Where a test copies the shape of a gold doc a rule once harmed, it is a look-alike, not gold text.
- **Run:** from `teams/01-data-a`: `python3 -m unittest discover -s spec_v1_1/tests`.
- **Last run:** 13 Nov 2026, 167 tests, **OK**:
  - 41 for the math medicines;
  - 44 for the science medicines;
  - 10 for the English medicines;
  - 7 for the Indic medicine;
  - 65 for the scripts (`test_collect_reading_prs.py` 39, `test_show_examples.py` 11, `test_reading_check.py` 10, `test_reading_recall.py` 5).

The numbers in the `#` column match the disease tables above. "Twice" means a test that runs the rule on its own output and expects no change.

### Math: `tests/test_medicine_math.py`, 41 tests

**For the whole sheet (3):**
- `test_one_rule_for_each_new_math_disease`: the sheet holds exactly the 8 math rules.
- `test_no_rule_uses_the_indic_code_c6`: no rule uses C6, the Indic family's code.
- `test_no_rule_touches_a_doc_with_no_pack`: every rule keeps a doc that has no `pack_id`.

| # | rule | test class (tests) | must change or drop | must stay | other checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `DA-C7-001` lost formulas | `C7Formulas` (6) | 4 gaps (`… tank B =`, `show that .`, `Comparing ,`, a line ending in "is"); empty options `(A)`–`(D)`; sentences cut where the formula was | answer options and lines that carry on to the next line; complete working; only 2 gaps; `=` with the answer below; option labels set above their options. These are the cases behind the gold false positives fixed on 12 Nov. | |
| 2 | `DA-C8-001` flattened formulas | `C8Formulas` (4) | a formula split one token per line | a column of plain numbers (post counts); a short run (`x + 2 = 5` over 6 lines); options one per line, like gold `8828b7bee424578d` | |
| 3 | `DA-C9-001` SEO filler | `C9` (3) | tutor sales, "math teachers in …", homework-app, road-distance and ebook-spinner pages (dropped); a "You are watching: …" line (removed) | an ordinary lesson that mentions a tutor | |
| 4 | `DA-A8-001` words run together | `A8` (6) | `HydrogenWhen` → `Hydrogen When`, `ProblemsThe` → `Problems The`, `minQuestions` → `min Questions`, `here.The` → `here. The` | brand and code names (`JavaScript`, `WordPress`, `PowerPoint`, `LinkedIn`, `YouTube`, `maxValue`); code lines and code fences | twice; off on sci-finepdfs and on another language (`hi`) |
| 5 | `DA-C8-002` merged table cells | `C8Tables` (2) | a flattened table row of 20 or more numeric tokens | short numeric lines; prose with numbers | |
| 6 | `DA-C9-003` template pages | `C9Templates` (8) | a number-fact page; one dollar amount in three headings; a unit-converter sentence; converter and conversion-table headings | a lesson with weak headings only; years and short numbers in headings; text with no headings | off on sci-finepdfs |
| 7 | `DA-D6-001` machine-written text | `D6` (5) | a forum's "In summary, the conversation …" line with its numbered FAQ, and the summary line alone (removed); an article with 2 machine-written signs (dropped) | a doc with one sign only | off on megamath |
| 8 | `DA-C7-002` lost figures | `C7Figures` (4) | a short problem with a missing figure; a long doc with two figure references | a long doc with one reference | off on finemath |

### Science: `tests/test_medicine_sci.py`, 44 tests

**For the whole sheet (3):**
- `test_one_rule_for_each_new_science_disease`: the sheet holds exactly the 12 science rules.
- `test_every_rule_is_off_on_other_packs`: every rule keeps a doc from a math pack or with no `pack_id`.
- `test_the_13_nov_rules_are_off_on_other_packs`: the 6 rules added on 13 Nov keep their own trigger text on other packs.

| # | rule | test class (tests) | must change or drop | must stay | other checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `DA-A7-001` line-end hyphen | `A7` (5) | `company- owned` → `company-owned`, `stereo- scopic` → `stereo-scopic`, `day- to-day` → `day-to-day` | suspended hyphens (`pre- and post-test`, `two- to three-fold`, `first- or second-order`, `low- versus high-dose`); other dashes (`x- axis`, a list dash, `a - b`, `Section A- Part`, `COVID- 19`, `pages 10- 12`) | twice |
| 10 | `DA-C8-003` two numbers in one cell | `C8Cells` (3) | `\| 332 50.4 \|  \|` → `\| 332 \| 50.4 \|` | full cells (`10 20` next to a filled cell); a row that doesn't start with `\|`; `1,323` with an empty cell | twice |

### English: `tests/test_medicine_english.py`, 10 tests

**For the whole sheet (4):**
- `test_one_rule_for_each_new_english_disease`: the sheet holds exactly the 2 English rules in force.
- `test_every_rule_is_off_on_other_packs`: each rule keeps a doc from en-dclm, en-fineweb-edu, a math pack, or with no `pack_id`.
- `test_each_rule_runs_only_on_its_pack`: `DA-D7-001` keeps a listed doc found on en-nemotroncc, and `DA-A8-003` keeps one on en-nemotroncc-synth.
- `test_appended_questions_and_answers_are_left_alone`: no rule removes a trailing Q&A, now that `DA-D6-002` is withdrawn.

| # | rule | test class (tests) | must change or drop | must stay | other checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | `DA-A8-003` no space after a full stop | `A8` (3) | `choose.Compose` → `choose. Compose`; `there.Then,` → `there. Then,` | `www.Google.com`, `e.g.The`, `Mr.Smith`, `Node.Js`, `awhile`, a code line, a code fence, an email address, a line with a URL | twice |
| 22 | `DA-D7-001` facts the rewrite got wrong | `D7` (3) | the 6 confirmed doc IDs (dropped) | `ffaad5c6d3dde332`, the appended-Q&A doc whose answer is correct; any other doc | |

**How the tests changed after the gold docs were read (13 Nov):**
- **English, `DA-D6-002` withdrawn:** its 5 tests were removed, and `test_appended_questions_and_answers_are_left_alone` was added. `DA-D7-001`'s tests now cover 6 IDs.
- **`DA-A7-003`:** `test_ordinary_capitals_in_the_gold_set_stay` was added, with look-alikes of the 3 gold docs the first version harmed.
- **`DA-C8-005`:** `test_dates_under_a_signature_stay` and `test_a_date_left_alone_after_a_page_line_goes_in_one_run` were added.
- **`DA-C7-004`:** `test_lines_of_empty_image_links_go` became `test_links_become_their_captions`. `test_links_with_no_caption_go` was added, and the twice test now expects the caption kept.

## Other families and diseases

- **Indic family (Data B):** C6, inconsistent punctuation and formatting (`DB-C6-001`, ind-te-sangraha-v, 161 of 500 docs).
  - **Medicine:** Data B's, Medicine 1 in #177. It turns runs of dots into `...`.
  - **Harm test:** Data B's, with `teams/02-data-b/tools/harm_test_indic.py`. On the old 18-doc gold (9 Nov): 1/18 changed, PASS, and the joiner and normal-form audits passed. The 80-doc run below replaces it.
  - **Run on ind-te-sangraha-v's 80-doc gold (aneeshads, 13 Nov):** the same tool and `--rule all`, on oddjoker91's `medicine.md`. Report: `indic_sangraha-v_harm.md` in this folder.

    | rule | changed | dropped | limit | joiners, normal form | result |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | C6 (`DB-C6-001`) | 2/80 (`01418489e7410bdf`, `85644a4840025b6f`) | 0 | 1 | ok | **FAIL**; 0/78 PASS with the 2 gold contradictions left out |
    | C1 | 0/80 | 0 | 1 | ok | PASS |
    | C2 | 0/80 | 0 | 1 | ok | PASS |
    | all in order | 2/80 | 0 | 1 | ok | **FAIL**; 0/78 PASS with them left out |

    - **The 2 docs:** each has a bare `..`, which the rule turns into `...`. Both readers (oddjoker91 and sreekanthzipsy) marked the docs clean. But oddjoker91 labelled a bare `..` as C6 in other docs: 23 C6 labels point at a 2-character span. So the docs hold the disease as the pack's reader defined it. They are gold contradictions (see "Gold contradictions" above).
    - **The pack file:** `ind-te-sangraha-v.parquet`, 500 docs, the pack that was read and labelled. The Week-1 copy in `Cap1-packs` holds none of the 80 gold docs. Its sha256, `d3d928606d1fd0a7a81fcbce10db3e3d8f4b7df74486bc51c9a9d30299812817`, is the `pack_sha256` in `../../../results/spec_v1/cleaner/specv1_ind-te-sangraha-v_harm.json` (theschoolofai/era-v5-lab#244). So it is the same file as the spec v1 harm run on this pack.
    - **What the rule reaches there:** it changes 241 of the 500 docs, including 144 of the 161 C6-labelled ones.
    - **A narrower version was tried and not taken.** It left a bare `..` alone and passed on all five packs (0/80, 0/24, 0/22, 0/24). But it fixed only 102 of the 161 labelled docs, so Data B's function was kept unchanged.
  - **Run on the sangraha-s packs (aneeshads, 13 Nov):** `teams/02-data-b/tools/harm_test_indic.py --rule all` on oddjoker91's `medicine.md`. Report: `indic_sangraha-s_harm.md` in this folder.

    | pack | gold docs (limit) | C6 | C1 | C2 | all in order | joiners, normal form |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | ind-hi-sangraha-s | 24 (1) | 0/24 PASS | 0/24 PASS | 0/24 PASS | 0/24 PASS | ok |
    | ind-kn-sangraha-s | 22 (1) | 0/22 PASS | 0/22 PASS | 0/22 PASS | 0/22 PASS | ok |
    | ind-te-sangraha-s | 24 (1) | 0/24 PASS | 0/24 PASS | 0/24 PASS | 0/24 PASS | ok |
    | ind-ta-sangraha-s | none | not testable | | | | |

    The rules have no pack check, so they ran on every gold doc and changed none. That is no harm on these packs. The disease was found on ind-te-sangraha-v, which this run doesn't cover.

    **The pack files** are the 500-doc samples published on the `sangraha-s-packs` branch of shankarpandala/era-v5-lab (commit `a836972`, 13 Nov). The packs come from the week-1 packs, from Sangraha's synthetic (translated) split, by AI4Bharat ([ai4bharat/sangraha](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4bharat/sangraha), CC-BY-4.0). The copies used match the sha256 values in that branch's `NOTICE.txt` (`shasum -a 256 -c`, all OK):

    | pack file | sha256 |
    |---|---|
    | `ind-hi-sangraha-s.parquet` | `7fd34f97729659a7c0c7f6bed0190e7f4eda29ed8a0f9b9eacbfe4a607a3ff6d` |
    | `ind-kn-sangraha-s.parquet` | `a161966005c037a1bdb70245c2b6135520967c57c5fc618cba5f29d9e248f427` |
    | `ind-ta-sangraha-s.parquet` | `40509e609fb6020649a86baf1b8e849659442ef8e807b02a842ac8f9f757b74d` |
    | `ind-te-sangraha-s.parquet` | `feeb676e76dee102d132846c1af2a92c3ea4d1018e0fd5239f50fc0da0fb6069` |
  - **In `specv1_1.md`:** Medicine 23, through `sheets/medicine_indic.md`. Data B's function is copied unchanged inside a `pack_id` check for ind-te-sangraha-v.
  - **Unit tests:** `tests/test_medicine_indic.py`, 7 tests:
    - runs of dots (`. .`, `..`, `. . .`, with spaces or tabs) become `...`, and `....` becomes `...`;
    - single dots, `…`, an existing `...`, dots across a line break and `3.67` stay;
    - joiners (ZWJ, ZWNJ) are untouched;
    - it is off on other packs, and a second run changes nothing.
- **Code:** no new disease above 1% was found, so no medicine or harm test is needed. 200 docs were read, by Revant and narasimhatejav (mittalutkarsh/era-v5-lab#6), and every code row is a spec v1 miss.
- **Not new** (already in `DISEASES.md`), so outside v1.1:
  - B1, C5, ligatures (A5), table of contents (C1), many questions on one page (C4), wrong PDF glyphs (A6), and personal names with ages (F1);
  - English two documents joined (C4, 4 docs). Spec v1 has no English C4 rule.
- **Below the bar in English:** 23 codes with 1 doc each; see `../../sheets/decisions_english.md`.
- **Below the bar:** 11 science diseases found in 1 of 200 docs each (0.5%), so they need no medicine. 6 are Aditeya's (A9 accent split, C7 all-figure doc, C7 figure labels, C8 split superscripts, C9 spun text, D6 picture captions) and 5 are Utkarsh's. See `NEW_DISEASES.md`.
